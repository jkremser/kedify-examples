# KEDA + Kafka: Improve performance by 62.15% at peak loads

[This blog post](www.kedify.io/blog-posts/keda-kafka-improve-performance-by-62-15-at-peak-loads) explores the integration of KEDA with Apache Kafka in Kubernetes environments, demonstrating a significant enhancement in Kafka consumer performance. By implementing KEDA, the post reveals a 62.15% reduction in consumer lag, highlighting improved resource efficiency and scalability. The approach and findings are exemplified through experiments contrasting consumer lag with and without KEDA, underscoring the benefits of dynamic scaling in cloud-native architectures.
